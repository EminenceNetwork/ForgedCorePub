## 📖 About the Game
Forged Core is a dystopian sci-fi FPS that throws you into the ruins of a collapsing future, where survival means diving headfirst into reactor sectors crawling with hostile machines and volatile environments.  

The central objective is simple, but brutal: collect four powerful **Core Batteries**, each hidden in increasingly dangerous locations, and survive long enough to bring them back to the reactor. Along the way, you’ll tackle side quests that reward you with rare equipment and materials, helping you push deeper into the chaos.  

Once all four Core Batteries are secured, players can return them to the heart of the reactor, forging devastating new weapons and advanced gear from the raw energy itself. But that’s just the beginning…
